Asset Share Commons proxies in the AEM WCM Core Components to allow authors to augment the asset share experience with robust content components.

Asset Share Commons 2.x now requires at least AWM WCM Core Components 2.14.0+ and you must provide it yourself. 

* In the case of AEM as a Cloud Service, AEM always provides the latest version of Core Components. 
* In the case of  AEM 6.5.7+ you must install AEM WCM Core Components yourself - ideally as part of your custom application that also includes Asset Share Commons.

Asset Share Commons 1.x ships with AEM WCM Core Components v1.1.0.
