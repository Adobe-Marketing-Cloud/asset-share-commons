AEM as a Cloud Service and 6.5 SP7+ release!

This is technically a breaking change release, however we attempted to minimize the changes!

The big changes are:

1. Adjusted project structure to adhere to AEM as a Cloud Service best practices.
2. Integrated with AEM as a Cloud Service's Async Download Framework.
