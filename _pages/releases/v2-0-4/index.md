Fixes a deployment issue with March 2021 AEM as a Cloud Service versions, where the Asset Share Commons' package dependency on Core Components 2.14.0 could not be resolved, resulting in AEM as a Cloud Service deploy failure.

Also updates Asset Share Commons AEM Components' Sling Model interfaces to be @ConsumerType for extensibility!
